# PyBer_Analysis #
## Overview of the analysis: ##
The purpose of this data analysis is to supply PyBer with insights into their business regarding the types of cities they are operating within, the frequency of rides within those city types and the overall fares associated with the rides. 

## Results: ##
We analyzed data by city types, rural vs suburban vs urban. There are clear patterns that appear in the data, as shown below:

As one would guess, far more rides were given in urban areas, probably due to lack of parking, shorter distances between stops and possibly a bigger nightlife.

Again, with more rides, comes more total drivers. When not as many rides exists, you won't have as many people driving.

The amount of rides/drivers accounts for the total fares being substantially higher in Urban areas.

The average fare per ride is really due to the distance customers must travel in lower-density areas, like rural or suburban areas.

The drivers are going to make far more money on a per ride basis in suburban or rural areas, but they aren't going to get as many rides.

## Summary: ##

Three recommendations I would like to make:
1. In rural or suburban areas could you potentially lower your fares to make taking PyBer more economical for the customer? One avoidance to using your service could potentially be the high cost of going a long distance. Maybe set up zones where the farther the ride mileage the fare lowers.
2. If you want to focus your business on your money-maker, the urban areas, do you have enough drivers? Are you able to adequately meet demand? Would it be advantageous to pull drivers from the suburban cities with some incentive to drive in the urban areas (more analysis is needed).
3. It appears the demand is trending down towards the summer in rural areas, possibly employ more of those drivers in your higher performing suburban or urban areas?
